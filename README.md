# RPG Heroes

A simple exercise to get started on C# and Unit Testing using XUnit.

## Installation

Got your Virtual Studio with .NET 6.0 (LTS) settled? All good. If there was something else, I cannot find it within the fires of my migrane, but you're smarter than me. You'll figure it out.

## Description

A simple simulation of creating Heroes for an RPG games and equipping them with various items to make numbers go bigger. So, just what I do 12 hours every weekend anyway.

## Authors and acknowledgment

Sean Skinner, for being a great teacher and speaker.

Erik, for programming ball planking. Seriously, this time around it was a BIG help, considering my health this week.

My coffee cup, for being my coffee cup.

## Project Status

All done, yet again!

Until maybe Sean breaks it this time, again (for sure).

But honestly, when it comes to C#, I can confidently say "Home Sweet Home".
